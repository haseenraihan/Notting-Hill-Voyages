Notting Hill Voyages â€” Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
==========================================

How to run:
1) Unzip this folder.
2) Double-click index.html (or serve with a simple static server).
3) Explore pages: visas.html, packages.html (+ package-*.html), about.html, contact.html, faq.html, terms.html, privacy.html.

Notes:
- Chat widget is front-end only (mock). WhatsApp button opens chat to +44 7385 608114 with a prefilled message.
- Forms show a success state without sending. To wire to email, use a service like Formspree/EmailJS or a server endpoint.
- All UI is black/white; photography remains colour.
- Smooth animations are CSS + IntersectionObserver (no external libraries).
